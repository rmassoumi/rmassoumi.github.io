### CPSC 120

* Lab 06

    Part 2 of lab 6 was my favorite because blackjack has always been one of my favorite card games! It was very interesting learning how to validate inputs from users 
    and use functions in order to ensure that the program ran properly. Applying what I had learned in the class to my favorite game was really fascinating and fueled
    my passion to improve at coding. 

* Lab 10

    Part 1 of lab 10 was the one of the most entertaining labs and has become one of my favorites. I really enjoyed learning how to grab data from a file and read strings from an input file. Additionally, using an interator to reverse a string challenged my skills, which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

* Lab 04

    Part 2 of lab 4 has become one of my favorite labs because of how fun it was to do! I was able to complete the assignment with little to no errors on the first try, which validated how much I was learning from the course. Also, I liked testing out the code and playing the Hi-Lo game in order to see if my code was working properly.
